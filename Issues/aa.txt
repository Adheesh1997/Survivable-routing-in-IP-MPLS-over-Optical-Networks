if having a backup lightpath, LSP.cpp 596
primary LSP bandwidth 739
primary LSP count
consider wavelength in deleteLpLink lightpathSettingUp.cpp, 927
erase backup lightpath, lightpathSettingup.cpp. 937
delete the correct lightpath lightpathSettingup.cpp 948, 954
  delete from wavelengthAndLSP, after that if(wavelenthAndLSP.size()==0), then delete the linkVector element
it has to be a primary lightpath LSP.cpp, 842
